## angular-data

__Data store for Angular.js.__

__Latest Release:__ [0.9.1](http://angular-data.codetrain.io/)
__master:__ [0.9.1](http://angular-data-next.codetrain.io/)

Angular-data is in a pre-1.0.0 development stage; the API is fluctuating, not a lot of tests yet, etc.

Not for production use (yet). If you still want to develop with Angular-data, be prepared to keep a close eye on the changelog, as the API is still liable to change before 1.0.0.

Roadmap:
- Relations/Associations
- Various Adapters
- Schema Definition/Validation
- Nested Resources
- See [issues](https://github.com/jmdobry/angular-data/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=open) for what's in development
- See [Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o069KLuBH4jpwm1FCLZFwKMgM73Xi8_1JyjhSxVpidM/edit?usp=sharing) for other juicy reading material
